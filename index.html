  <h3> The most common IIoT use cases are improved quality assurances and, more precisely, consistent machine monitoring.

Quality Assurance
IIoT devices can automate certain monitoring functions to reduce human error in quality assurance (QA). For example, if a part is made incorrectly, a camera or other sensor connected to the machine can detect the error earlier so the part doesn’t move forward in the production process, and so a corrected part can be manufactured.

If QA is only handled by humans, mental and physical fatigue can become a factor. Mistakes are made, or documentation suffers. That is why at General Electric (GE), robots with cameras and artificial intelligence (AI) are starting to take part in the inspections and documentation. However, humans won’t be entirely removed from the QA process.

According to Colin Parris, VP of GE software and AI research, the AI GE uses has a zone of competency that is based on the environmental context. For example, if the AI is basing its inspection on a model made in the summer (a hot and humid environment) and it is now winter (a cold and dry environment), the environmental context is different and the AI is working outside of its zone of competency.

Whenever the AI is working outside its zone of competency, a human operator must verify the data. Parris added that GE looks at what employees do in that scenario and use that information to improve the AI.

Machine Monitoring
By monitoring the status and health of machines at all times, malfunctions can be caught sooner. Temperature sensors can be used to monitor the overall status of the machines. Vibration sensors can monitor the health of a machine’s components. If the health of one component starts to deteriorate, it can be replaced, which prevents a failure that could have caused additional damage to the machine.

By identifying health issues earlier, technicians can mitigate damage and machines are down for repairs for a fraction of the time. In addition, having detailed data on the overall health of a machine means replacements and repairs can be done when they are actually needed, and not based on the machine’s suggested timeline. This avoids long machine downtime from failures between scheduled maintenance and saves manufacturers money as they aren’t paying for unnecessary repairs and machine components.</h3>
